# Building An Award-Winning Email Newsletter

This repository contains slides for the workshop I presented at
Cascade Public Media on March 8, 2018.

The slides can be viewed here: https://lisawilliams.github.io/email/

The presentation is built with Reveal.js, a framework
for building web-ready presentations in HTML. [Check out the live demo of Reveal.js](http://revealjs.com/).

I relied on Chen Hui Jing's [excellent tutorial on doing slide decks in Reveal.js](https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/revealjs-and-github-pages/#%F0%9F%91%9F) to get started.
