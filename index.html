			</section>
			<section>
				What was different about The Magic Pill?
			</section>
			<section>
				It was based on user research.
			</section>
			<section>
				It was an 'Audio newsletter,'<br>
				not a podcast
			</section>
			<section>
				It was short.
			</section>
			<section>
				It was limited.
			</section>
			<section>
				It was unique to each subscriber -- every subscriber got their own 'Day One.'
			</section>
			<section>
				Magic Pill could respond to user behavior.
			</section>
			<section>
				We used selective marketing.
